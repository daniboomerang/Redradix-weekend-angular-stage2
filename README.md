# Technologies:

 * Back-end: nodejs
 * Front-end: Angularjs

# Description:

 * This project (GNAs Container) is a Angular app that contains all the random number generators developed in the Stage 1.
 * The project is aimed to show how to organize big projects in Angular (though this is not a big one).
 * The idea is to show the 5 angular apps of the Stage 1 as a independent modules of the GNAs Container.
 * For that there is the need to learn some about ngRoute and $location.
